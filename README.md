# cribisi.github.io Final Project Submission
-Project: Hound Dogs
-Purpose: To provide a friendly environment where you can find furry friends
-How it works: This is a website that allows you to view the locations of dogs on a map if you are looking to run into one on campus. Also, if you sign up and become a user, you can add dogs to the map.
-This repository is not very organized, it basically just has all our source code files for the website.
-To run the website go to  https://hound-dogs.herokuapp.com/FrontPage.html
-To find our test cases for some of our files, look for a commit comment labled for unit testing
-The tests for these files can be run with php unit using instructions in the TESTING.md File found in the Group 13 Repository
